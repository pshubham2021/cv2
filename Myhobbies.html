<h1>My hobbies</h1>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Writing/Blogging
        Writing can be a great hobby for programmers. You can combine your
         passion of writing with your passion for programming. Keeping a journal or writing a novel for
          fun can give you a great experience. Also, it is an amazing way of keeping a record of all what
           you’re thinking and memories.</li>

    <li>A survey shows that 24.6% programmers love to play serious board games.
         Playing board games is one of the best ways to connect with people. While a lot
          of people choose video games over this, but it just doesn’t give that personal feeling.
           This doesn’t mean that you cannot play board
         games online, there are sites where you can play it with people across the globe.</li>  
         
    <li>Professional photographers often use similar skills as programmers.
         Just like programmers, photographers need intense problem-solving skills.
          Many people who have photography as their hobby find it very relaxing.
           Well the most important skill that a programmer can learn by taking up photography 
           as a hobby is patience. A photographer requires a lot of patience as he/she might has to
           wait for hours to get that perfect shot and as you know how much patience it requires
            while coding </li>
    <li>Cooking is a delicate process which requires a lot of attention, you need to analyze 
        recipes and how to bring the ingredients together. The tricks of the trade lie in following
         the recipes correctly. Miss out on a couple of steps you might end up making it a disaster.
          Programmers just like the cooks know the importance of paying attention to work, or you might
           end up giving bad results. Cooking can also be a stress buster.</li> 
    <li>Video games are an amazing way to relax. You can enjoy and play with your friends anytime 
        you want no matter how far away they are from you. Some puzzle games as they help in 
        exercising your mind.</li>                  

    <li>Sports and Exercise are not only about losing weight and looking good,
         they serve much more than that. Playing any sport or exercising often helps in
          overcoming anxiety. It helps in relaxing your mind. Swimming, yoga, going to 
          a gym can help you refresh your mind and it keeps you mentally strong. It also helps
           people in sleeping better.</li>    
    <li>Everyone likes music, even if it is just listening to music. There is always
         a playlist of songs which helps in refreshing your mind. It is the kind of a 
         hobby you can do along with the above-mentioned ones, like you can listen to music while
          cooking, exercising, while playing video games etc.</li>
